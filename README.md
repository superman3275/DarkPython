DarkPython
==========


DarkPython is an education-focused IDE programmed in pure Python. It was made with the student in mind and is easy to use.


DarkPython features:


* Syntax Highlighting!

* Editing multiple files at once!

* A feature rich debugger!


The main appeal of using DarkPython is it's debugger. The debugger runs in it's own thread. It features:


* Line by line execution.

* Line highlighting during execution to show what python is doing at any given moment.

* Values of all variables are updated at each line and kept in an easy to read, tabular format.

* A great GUI built off of wxPython.


DarkPython clarifies Python programming like never before!
