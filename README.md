The main appeal of using DarkPython is it's debugger. The debugger runs in it's own thread. It features:


* Line by line execution.

* Line highlighting during execution to show what python is doing at any given moment.

* Values of all variables are updated at each line and kept in an easy to read, tabular format.

* A great GUI built off of a fast wxPython backend.
